You need Java 11.

You need an IDE, ideally Eclipse because it's the best.

You need Gradle in order to build the project. Gradle imports some of Google's APIs.

You need a credentials.json file. You can get one by setting up a Google developer account. When setting up a Google developer account, specify that you want access to the Gmail and YouTube APIs. Once you have a credentials file, place it into "src/main/resources".
