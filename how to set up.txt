You need Java 11.

You need an IDE, ideally Eclipse because it's the best.

You need to Gradle in order to build the project since it uses some of Google's APIs.

You need a credentials.json file. You can get one by setting up a Google developer account. When setting up a Google developer account, specify that you want access to the Gmail and YouTube APIs. Once you have one, place it into "src/main/resources".
