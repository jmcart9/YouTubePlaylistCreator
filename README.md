# YouTube Playlist Creator

###### Motivation. 
I subscribe to a lot of informative YouTube channels. In fact, I subscribe to so many channels that, at the moment, I have over 1,000 unopened video upload notifications within my inbox. For an individual such as myself who desires to have a clean inbox, this mass of clutter is not desireable. Unfortunately, if I delete the notifications without having watched their respective videos, realistically I will not remember to watch them. If only there was a way to delete the video notifications from my inbox while adding the videos to a YouTube playlist. Then my inbox would be clean, and I could just use the playlist at my convenience.

There is a way to do that. Hence the existence of this application. 

It's still a work in progress. If you want to try it or contribute to it, read [how to set up](https://github.com/jmcart9/YouTubeProgram/blob/master/set_up.md).

###### Technologies used.

+ Java 11. At the time of this writing, the most-recent version of Java. Most of the 
+ Gradle. For importing some of Google's APIs.
