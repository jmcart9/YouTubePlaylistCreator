# YouTubeProgram

Motivation. I subscribe to a lot of informative YouTube channels. In fact, I subscribe to so many channels that, at the moment, I have over 1,000 unopened video upload notifications within my inbox. For an individual such as myself who desires to have a clean inbox, this mass of clutter is not desireable. Unfortunately, if I delete the notifications without having watched their respective videos, realistically I will not remember to watch them. If only there were a way to delete the video notifications from my inbox while adding the videos to a YouTube playlist. Then my inbox would be clean, and I could just use the playlist at my convenience.
