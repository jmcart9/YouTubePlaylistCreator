# YouTube Playlist Creator

###### Motivation. 
I subscribe to informative YouTube channels. When a video is uploaded onto one of those channels, YouTube sends a notification to my Gmail inbox. I subscribe to so many channels that, at the time of this writing, I have over a thousand video notifications within my inbox. This clutter is undesireable, so the notifications need to be deleted. Unfortunately, if the notifications are deleted before their linked videos are viewed, realistically I will not remember to watch them. 
There needs to be a way to delete the video notifications from my gmail inbox while adding the videos to YouTube playlists. Then my inbox would be clean, and I could use the playlists at my convenience.

There is a way to do that. Hence the existence of this application. 

It's still a work in progress. If you want to try it or contribute to it, read [how to set up](https://github.com/jmcart9/YouTubeProgram/blob/master/set_up.md).

###### Technologies used.

+ Java 12. At the time of this writing, the most-recent version of Java.
+ Gradle. For importing some of Google's APIs.
